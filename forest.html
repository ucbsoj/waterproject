		<h2>The forests get first dibs on all of the state's snowmelt.</h2>

		<p>
			The Sierra's vast forests have grown to an unhealthy density due to a century of poor management and fire suppression. Historically there might have been 100 trees per acre, but now that number is closer to 1,000 per acre.
		</p>
		<p>
			All those trees need water, and their water comes from the same source as much of California: the mountain snow.

				Thinning the trees in the mountains could allow more water to reach the streams, says Roger Bales, a hydrologist at the University of California, Merced.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the forest is too dense, less snow reaches the ground and evaporates. researchers says by removing patches of trees, we can allow more snow to reach the ground and streams.
