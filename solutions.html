			<div class="leaky-graf">In the past two years alone, the city of Sacramento has seen almost ten water main breaks. On a particularly bad one in December 2013, over 500,000 gallons of water gushed onto a roadway, stopping traffic for some time. The problem, Metro officials said, was old pipes.<br><br>With 240 water main breaks every year and leaking pipes accounting for 7 billion gallons of wasted water daily in the US, spending to replace these pipes may be the best way for a city to reduce water wastage.</div>
			<div id="leaky-pull">In San Diego, where there is an average of 105 water main breaks each year, the city estimates 6.6 million gallons gushed out of ruptured mains in 2013. Last year, the city replaced 28 miles of piping. They are looking to replace all their cast-iron pipes by 2017.</div>
			<div class="leaky-graf">A six-inch water main that broke in San Francisco in Feb 2014 was found to be 81-years old. And just a year earlier, another pipe in the area had burst, also from old age, and flooded 23 homes.<br><br>The state Department of Health Services now requires cities to replace at least 10 miles of these old-cast iron pipes each year. Experts say the pipes were not designed to last more than 30 years.
